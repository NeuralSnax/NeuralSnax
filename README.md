# 🤖💥 Welcome to **NeuralSnax's Lab** 🍿  
_Where code learns, snacks back, and sometimes... breaks reality._

## 🧠 Who Dis?  
Hey! I'm **Rahul** – a curious coder teaching machines how to think (and occasionally vibe).  
I blend 🔬 science, 🤓 curiosity, and 💥 creativity to build stuff that:
- **Learns from data**
- **Lives on Android**
- **And maybe becomes self-aware (but nicely)**

## 🍿 What's Cookin'?

> _This repo is like my brain: always training, occasionally overfitting._ 😅

Here's what you'll bump into:

- 🧬 **AI & Machine Learning Projects**  
    From vanilla regressions to spicy neural networks, I try it all.

- 📱 **Android + ML Magic**  
    I build apps where AI does cool stuff *on the go* (TFLite is my sidekick).

- ⚗️ **Wild Experiments**  
    Expect chaos. Expect learning. Expect code that asks _“What if?”_

## 🚀 Rahul's Current Obsessions  
⚡ Generative AI (yes, I’ve made stuff that dreams)  
📦 TinyML — running models on tiny devices like a wizard  
🔧 AutoML & hyperparameter hacking  
🎨 Making AI fun, weird, and maybe even beautiful

---

## 🎉 Fun Facts  
- 🔢 I once got stuck debugging because I mistyped `.fit()` as `.fizz()`
- 💭 If I could train an AI to make me chai, I would.
- 🧠 I name my models like pets. My last one? “Sir Layers-a-Lot.”

## 🌌 Rahul's Motto  
> _"There’s beauty in a well-trained model... and chaos in an unbalanced dataset."_  

_Stay weird, stay curious,_
